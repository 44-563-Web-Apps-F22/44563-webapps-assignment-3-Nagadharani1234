    <p>Norwich Terriers are plucky little earthdogs named for their hometown in England.
         The old cliche "a big dog in a small package" was coined for breeds like the Norwich,
          who can be oblivious to the fact that they are just 10 inches tall..</p>

            <li>
                In 1842, the English naturalist Sir Richard abraham coined the term Norwich, 
                derived from the latin word, meaning.
            </li>
            <li>Although these are purebred dogs, you may still find them in shelters and rescues.</li>
            <li>These highly affectionate dogs make for great apartment pets, and theyâ€™ll get along with everybody, including kids, other dogs, 
                and even strangers who come to your door. </li>
